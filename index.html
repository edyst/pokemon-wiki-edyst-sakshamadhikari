            you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of <br>
            electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers<br>
             should be able to answer.

        <li  class="ans_margin">Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're <br>
            looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, <br>
            you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button <br>
